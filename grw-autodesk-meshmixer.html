TL;DR: Megathron and Abbadon 3D printed - models + some making of shots here: https://imgur.com/a/ttQZRj5 (https://imgur.com/a/ttQZRj5) amp#x200B; Hi all, I saw the 3D printing bandwagon and thought I would post some recent models I did myself - in particular the Megathron and Abbadon (which are some of my favourite models in the subcap category).

I am trying to learn Virtual Reality by creating a virtual museum sort of thing. One of the most elaborate models that I found and that has me fascinated is that of Cosmic Buddha from Smithsonian website (https://3d.si.edu/explorer/cosmic-buddha-laser-scan). Even the 1M polygon model from the website is a bit too big for mobile VR. There is also a 10M polygon available. The files available for download do not include any textures and I am sure Blender Hello, I'm new to 3D printing but I can see it being extremely useful to my field. This model was 3d scanned. I've done and learned a ton of the basic operations and I'm on the LAST STEP I'm using Autodesk meshmixer to edit the model for print. I'm trying to add supports and finally send it off to be printed. However, when I click "generate support" nothing happens. Rather, it was working alright but I was trying to refine the outcome via the sliders etc. Now when I hit generate it says 0 conne. So I have those scans of people that I need to clean (texture and mesh) for 3D printing using Bodypaint and the Sculpting tools in Cinema 4D. The only thing I don't know how to do is making the mesh hollow and adding holes for printing. I know you can do that in Autodesk Meshmixer but it export in ply which really create very low resolution texture, so I'd like to do everything in C4D if possible, or hollowing in another software if necessary but which.

I recently installed Autodesk Meshmixer to modify some 3d models which (previously) came out with 0mm wall thickness (in fact, on Cura, the Layer View appears blank). gt Import into Meshmixer (free) and make sure the object is a solid volume. How do I understand that? I gave a look to my model, but it's unclear if it's a solid volume or not. gt If you want this to print as a hollow shape, there's a tool (under Edit gt Hollow, IIRC) that will let you specify a wall thickness.

MeshMixer: A tool for working with mesh models; Autodesk Catch. Hey all, Recently I made something in zBrush to be 3Dprinted. I'm not really like adanced in the world of 3d printing, but I know a thing or two. I exported the things as an OBJ, and imported it in Autodesk Meshmixer to check for errors and generate support structures (was planning on putting it in Slic3r later). Little did I know- it fixed a thing or two, but also deleted whole parts of my mesh. I surfed the web to find out what this magenta color means, and found it it had something Meshmixer is the ultimate tool for 3D mashups and remixes.

For example if I have a hole that is intended for a screw to pass though for mounting. I would like to reinforce that area either through infill or additional Outlines shells. Im currently using simplify 3d but am open to others. In S3D you can apply a process to a certain height range of the print. So in this case my holes have a vertical orientation and I can make the layer range that they appear in have additional shells or more infill but this of course makes those changes Report a Bug.
