Disclaimer: I sent a similar draft of my review to an online friend, so I'm basically copy pasting it here. Also note that I watched the film 2 days after its release in February, so I apologize for any mistakes/inconsistencies. Anyhoo, let's begin. As much as I want to say that I left the theater last month feeling wholly satisfied with how the film turned out to be, I'd be lying.

I wish Dreamworks could do more HTTYD films but if this HTTYD is the end of the movie series, then I think i don't really like the ending. In some point I dont even think this ending makes sense. At the end of the movie it seems like all the dragons have been moved to the hidden world, but actually I think only Berk's dragons moved. Even the Berserkers' and the Outcasts' dragons were not moved to THW, not to mention those dragons trapped by dragon hunters out there and other dragon armies. Watch Dragons Riders Of Berk Episode 2. The further adventures of Hiccup and his friends on the Island I have a bit of a rant about how Riders of Berk and Race to the Edge decided to handle the character development of Snotlout. I believe he has been repeatadly been underused as a character, and he has come across as unlikable and childish in every season of every show, despite having the potential for being much more. Snotlout, in principle, should have been a great character. He stands in contrast to Hiccup, the guy who has it all. He has status, due to being the first Dragon Rider. 3 мар 2019 - 2 мин. - Добавлено пользователем Toys 2 BoysУра!

Valka, I believe, is not a Viking, but was a Scythian female warrior who came from the Scythian (Siberian steppe-peoples) culture around the Baltic Sea region.

I'm really hoping for some more Hiccstrid moments in the next season of RTTE!  mine how to train your dragon hiccup dob dragons riders of berk defenders. Just a little backstory: I saw the first movie in theaters. I was 10, and at the time it seemed like the perfect kid’s movie, but that’s what it was. A KID’s movie. I saw Riders and Defenders of Berk on Cartoon Network as they aired, just because they were cool shows to watch. I saw the sequel on Netflix a year after it came out.

Season 1 Dragon Flower : Trader Johann’s interoduction. He gives Mildew Blue Oleander, which Dragons are allergic to. Mildew weaponizes this.
